# CAFENOVA DATA ANALYSIS (Interactive Dashboard Using MS Excel) 

## Project Objective
CafeNova is a fast-growing casual dining chain offering a wide range of meals and beverages across multiple outlets. While sales have grown steadily, the management team was unsure of what items, categories, and customer segments were driving the most value or where they were losing money.

I was tasked to **clean, analyze, and deliver insights** using historical sales data. The goal was to uncover what’s working, what’s not, and make clear recommendations — all presented in a professional **interactive dashboard**.

## Dataset Used

## Key Questions (KPIs)
- Total Revenue  
- Best Selling Category  
- Best Selling Item  
- Number of Unique Customers  
- Monthly Sales Trend  
- Year with Highest Sales & Orders  
- Most Used Payment Method  
- Top 4 Customers  
- Interactive Dashboard [View Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/Melvi-kene/CAFENOVA-DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/main/scrnli_RDoF6e6f3FZki6.png)

## Process
1. Verified data for missing values and anomalies, then cleaned accordingly.  
2. Ensured data consistency in type, format, and values.  
3. Created pivot tables to answer the KPIs.  
4. Merged all pivot tables into a single interactive dashboard using **slicers** for dynamic analysis.
